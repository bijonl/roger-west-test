# General Notes

- I would not normally put all the HTML in one file, but for the sake of time, I didn't spin up a new WordPress site where it would be organized in a better file structure. 
- I would also normally use Gulp (or some compiler) to minify my CSS files, though I usually use SCSS
- Monstserrat was the most similar free alternative, so to avoid paying for Adobe, I opted for that. 
- I added an a dark overlay on the wildcard since the text on image wouldn't pass ADA regulations.
